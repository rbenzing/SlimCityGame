# 9. Risks & scope guards

1. **One-giant-file regression** — module boundaries, TS strict, and the
   `sim`/`render` firewall guard against it.
2. **AI asset inconsistency** — a style bible and curation (§5.3); nothing
   is generated at runtime.
3. **Scope creep** — nothing "feels like a city builder" until the core
   loop works; the discipline that got M0–M3 to the magic moment (defer
   anything that doesn't serve the next milestone's exit criteria) applies
   to every epic since, including the one in progress now.

Three items that used to live here were decisions, not risks, and are now
ADRs: banning per-agent traffic simulation, deferring curved/freeform
roads, and pinning the Three.js version. See [adr/](../engineering/adr/README.md).
